## **The Adventure**

* **Target:** 3-4 Level 3 Characters.  
* **Setting:** The quiet logging village of Oakhaven.  
* **Theme:** Rogue clockwork machines, a missing tinkerer, and volatile arcane machinery.  
* **Content:** Includes read-aloud text, skill checks, a riddle/puzzle (The Gear Lock), and two distinct combat encounters (The Scrap Hounds & The Clockwork King).

## **Integrated Combat Engine**

This single-file HTML application includes a robust, state-preserving combat tracker built directly into the adventure text, allowing DMs to run the game without external tabs or tools.

### **Key Features**

* **Global Party Manager:** Input your players' stats (AC, Max HP, Init Mod) before the game. They dynamically import into every combat encounter.  
* **State Preservation:** Encounter states are strictly cached. HP, conditions, and spell slots are perfectly preserved even if you switch back and forth between encounters.  
* **Smart Initiative:** Auto-roll monster initiatives with a single click while safely preserving any manually typed PC initiatives. Auto-sorts the turn order (handling ties via Initiative Modifiers).  
* **Inline Stat Blocks:** Click the "Stats" button next to any monster during combat to expand their full stat block directly inside the initiative tracker.  
* **Rapid HP Tracking:** Quick \+ and \- buttons for quick math, plus custom value inputs for massive damage or healing.
